# NHL Play-by-Play Viewer using R Shiny

This repo contains my first-ever [R Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) project.  It's simple, but the app allows us to query and visualize the NHL's Play-by-play event logs for a given game.  

The app also leverages a simple shot probability model that I built. That repo can [be found here](https://github.com/Btibert3/nhl-pbp).
